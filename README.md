# credit_card_defaults_project


This project aims to predict how capable each client is of paying off their credit card balances. 
The dataset represents default and non-default accounts of credit card clients in Taiwan from 2005. 
Using this historical data, I will try to build a predictive model that classifies whether an account will pay off its next monthâ€™s balance or default. 

The dataset has the following attributes: 

ID
LIMIT_BAL
SEX
EDUCATION
MARRIAGE
AGE
PAY_1
PAY_2
PAY_3
PAY_4
PAY_5
PAY_6
BILL_AMT1

The code for this project was written by me with the help of GPT-3.5 to write occasional expressions and syntax.
